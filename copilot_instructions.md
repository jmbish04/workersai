## Package Manager Fallback Strategy

### CI/CD Reliability: npm vs pnpm
While pnpm is efficient locally, npm is more reliable in GitHub Actions due to:
- Better lock file handling when pnpm-lock.yaml is missing  
- More forgiving dependency resolution
- Built-in Node.js compatibility
- Mature CI/CD ecosystem support

### Deployment Best Practice:
Default to npm for production deployments unless pnpm-specific features are required. This ensures maximum CI/CD compatibility and reduces deployment failures.

### Fallback Implementation:
The GitHub Actions workflow includes automatic fallback from pnpm to npm when lock files are missing or incompatible.
